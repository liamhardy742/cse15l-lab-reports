# The command that I will be choosing is grep.  
The website I used to find the options and descriptions of what they do is [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html)  
  
## The four options I will be researching are -rl, -cv, -n, and --exclude-dir=*GLOB*. 
  
  

The first option is -rl, which is a combination of the -r and -l options. This recursively searches the directory given as a command line argument (from the -r part), and prints the file names of the files that are found to conatin the command line argument that grep is searching for (from the -l part).  

  
The section option is -cv, which is a combination of the -c and the -v options. This prints the count of the files found (from the -c part), where the files found are files where no match is found (from the -v part).  
  
  
The third option is -n, which modifies the output so that the user can see the line number that the match appears on for each of the files found.  
  
  
The fourth option is -i which performs a normal grep search but ignores the case of the matching string it is looking for. For example, when looking for "CaliforniA", "california" would be found as a match.
